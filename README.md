# Los Angeles Crime Dashboard

This dashboard presents an analysis of crime statistics over the last year in Los Angeles by LAPD area station.

The purpose of the dashboard is to provide users with relevant knowledge that can inform decisions such as relocation, travel, school selection and more.

The user is provided with visualizations related to victim demographics that are easy to absorb and presented in a clear format.

To use the application, simply select the button with the visualization you would like to explore from the homepage.

These visualizations are powered by data from the Los Angeles Open Data resource (https://data.lacity.org/). The specific dataset utilized was "Crime Data from 2020 to Present".

Ethical considerations were incorporated. There was no identifying information on individuals included in this analysis, all remain anonymous.
An effort was made to include all ages, sexes, and races present in the dataset. Counts and percentages are based solely on what is present in the data and not altered in any way.

It is possible that some users may draw conclusions about crime in L.A. based on personal bias or discrimination towards persons of certain sex, race, and age.
While we cannot prevent individual bias and discrimination, we can be certain this project is not furthering it by ensuring an objective analysis and presentation.
